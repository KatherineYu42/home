				Welcome to the world of bird feeding&#33; Learn how to attract a huge variety of beautiful birds to your backyard with just a simple feeder&#33; &#40; maybe multiple... you would be amazed at how addicting bird feeders are&#41;

				Types of Feeders
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are so many types of feeders. Hopper, tray, tube &#45; which kind will attract the most birds&#63;  This can be quite daunting for beginner birders. But to make it even more complicated, you also have to make sure the feeder is easy to clean, will stand up to the weather and wildlife, and is easy for birds to eat from. Here's the breakdown&#58;
			</p>
			<img src="./images/trayfeeder.png" alt="tray feeder" width="300" height="200" align="right">
			<h3>
				<br><br><br><br><br>Tray feeder
			</h3>
			<p>
				The tray feeder is probably the simplest &#45; a platform that holds seed. Because they are so simple, they are easy to clean, but the contents are often open to the elements, and feed will go rotten quickly. Try to buy or make a feeder with a mesh bottom, because they allow water to drain away, keeping the seed fresh.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tray feeders can be hung up or placed on the ground. However, the openness of a tray feeder will be taken advantage of, and you might find yourself being raided by unwelcome visitors like squirrels and raccoons&#33;<br> Birds that visit tray feeders&#58;

			<h3>
				House/Hopper Feeders
			</h3>
			<p>
				House feeders, also known as hoppers, are the stereotype of birdfeeders &#45; the traditional house shaped feeder which dispenses food at the bottom, through a small gap. The friction between the seeds prevent them from all spilling out at the same time. These feeders protect the feed from the elements better, but are harder to clean. These also attract a wide variety of birds, and undesirables like starlings and squirrels find it harder to reach the food. <br> Birds that'll visit&#58;

			<h3>
					Window Feeders
			</h3>
				<p>
					Window feeders are arguably the coolest type. They are small plastic containers that attach to windows with suction cups or hook onto windows, and you can see the birds right in front of your eyes&#33; These are usually easy to clean, as they are made of clear plastic. Although you might think having a feeder right next to the window could cause a collision, scientists have reported window feeders are actually the safest kind, because it is unlikely that the bird will want to fly past the feeder. <br> Birds you will find at your window include&#58;

			<h3>
				Tube Feeders
			</h3>
			<p>
				Tube feeders are, as the name suggests, long tubes filled with seed that dispense seed through small holes. These types of feeders are well suited for smaller birds that can fit on the perches. Some cons include the fact that they are harder to clean, and easier for squirrels to attack.

				Feed
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many types of feed. Some attract groundfowl, others songbirds, and still others woodpeckers and nuthatches. But which type of feed is right for your backyard&#63;  It depends on the birds you want to attract.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Sunflower
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are 2 types of sunflower seeds &#45; black oil and striped. Striped sunflower have a harder shell and are popular among grosbeaks like cardinals, while black oil have thinner shells and obviously, contain more oil. Black oil seeds are very nutritious, and are a favourite among a huge number of birds, including woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches and more. If you were to only have one kind of seed, black oil would definitely be the best.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Safflower
			</h3>
			<p>
				Safflower seeds are similar to striped sunflower, but they're not as popular because of their thick shells. Some sources claim cardinals actually prefer safflower over sunflower, but this hasn't been proven.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Nyjer/Thistle
			</h3>
			<p>
				Nyjer is the small, oily seed of type of daisy &#45; it's not really thistle at all&#33; Thistle or not, seed eating birds like sparrow, goldfinches and redpolls love it&#33; Because the seeds are so small, a special feeder with tiny holes is needed, or a nyjer mesh sock.
			</p>
			<h3>
				White Proso Millet
			</h3>
			<p>
				A favourite among ground foraging birds, jays, quails, doves, sparrows and more will all flock to this garden staple. However, pest species like house sparrows also enjoy millet, so it's best to use black oil sunflower instead.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Corn
			</h3>
			<p>
				Like white millet, groundfowl also enjoy cracked or shelled corn. However, corn often contains a toxin deadly to birds, so be very cautious when feeding. Never buy corn in plastic bags or allow it to get damp.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Peanuts
			</h3>
			<p>
				The jay&#39;s favourite, crows, chickadees, titmice and woodpeckers will also stop by for this high protein food. Watch out, because squirrels and raccoons are also huge fans, and will go to great lengths for a bite.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Specialty Feeds
			</h2>
			<p>
				Some birds like orioles and hummingbirds eat different foods. To see some of these beautiful birds, you have to provide them with their own food.
			</p>
			<h3 id="bkmk3">
				Nectar
			</h3>
			<p>
				Nectar feeders will attract orioles and hummingbirds&#33; They usually have feeding ports attached to a cylinder filled with a 1&#584; sugar water solution. Use orange and red to attract them.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Oriole Feeders
			</h3>
			<p> 
				Although hummingbird feeders can attract orioles, there are also ways to target orioles specifically. Orioles will come for fruit, orange in particular, nectar, and expecially grape jelly. Place all these things on a feeder and you may be treated to a flash of orange this summer&#33;
			</p>
			<h3>
				Suet Feeders
			</h3>
			<p>
				Suet is the excess fat from beef, which is usually thrown away. But, birders have found a use for them&#33; After boiling the fat, the melting point goes up, allowing birders to place blocks of cow fat in suet cages for the birds&#33; Although it probably doesn't sound too appetizing to us, birds love it. Some birds you would see at a suet feeder include chickadees, nuthatches, titmice, and woodpeckers.
